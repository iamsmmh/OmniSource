"""Trending score engine for the OmniSource discovery layer.

The score combines four signals from already-generated artifacts (state, health,
verification, analytics). It is a deterministic, explainable 0..1 value that the
website and any future client can use to surface "what is hot" without
external services.

Score formula
-------------
::

    trending_score =
        recency_signal     * 0.40
      + availability_signal * 0.20
      + featured_bonus     * 0.20
      + verification_bonus * 0.20

* ``recency_signal`` decays linearly from 1.0 (released today) to 0.0 after
  ``RECENCY_FLOOR_DAYS`` days. New releases are the strongest discovery signal.
* ``availability_signal`` is 1.0 when the download is currently reachable,
  0.0 otherwise (degraded reduces it to 0.5).
* ``featured_bonus`` is 1.0 when the catalog marks the app as ``featured``.
* ``verification_bonus`` maps the verification level to a number — VERIFIED
  is 1.0, COMMUNITY is 0.7, MANUAL is 0.4, UNVERIFIED is 0.0.

The function returns the rounded score plus a per-signal breakdown so the
website can show the formula on hover / in tooltips.
