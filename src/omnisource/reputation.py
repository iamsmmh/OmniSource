"""Source reputation engine.

A "source" in OmniSource is the upstream identity that publishes a given
app. Reputation is an explainable 0..100 score built from six signals:

* **JSON validity** — every app of the source has a well-formed feed entry
  (bundle id, version, download URL) in the published ``apps.json`` shape.
* **Uptime** — fraction of health probes that found the download reachable
  (30-day rolling window; current probe used when no history exists).
* **Update frequency** — average gap (in days) between consecutive releases,
  plus the age of the newest release.
* **Broken links** — releases that were later removed / re-published
  (rolled back, yanked, or replaced within 24 hours) and downloads that the
  latest health pass could not reach.
* **Release activity** — number of releases published in the past year.
* **Metadata completeness** — share of the source's apps that fill in every
  display-critical field (name, description, icon, category, subtitle).

Score bands keep the long-standing numeric ``level`` labels (consumed by
``js/site.js`` and the badges):

* **TRUSTED**      85..100
* **RELIABLE**     70..84
* **AVERAGE**      50..69
* **EXPERIMENTAL**  0..49

On top of the score, every source carries an explicit lifecycle ``status``
(Phase 5 of the modernization brief) that the website renders as a badge:

* **Verified**          score >= 85, valid JSON, healthy uptime
* **Community Verified** score >= 70, valid JSON
* **Maintained**        active but below the verified bar
* **Warning**           broken links / failing downloads / invalid metadata
* **Inactive**          no release in more than a year
* **Deprecated**        every app of the source is unmaintained/deprecated

The document is consumed by the website (badges throughout), the static
``sources/<slug>/`` pages, ``feeds/reputation.json`` and the
``api/reputation.json`` mirror.
