"""Verification system.

Trust levels are computed from observable facts, not claims:

``VERIFIED``
    The app is distributed by its official upstream (developer release, the
    developer's own feed, or a source the catalog marks official) and every
    offline/runtime check passed.
``COMMUNITY VERIFIED``
    The app is a community-built package (e.g. a community IPA of a tweak whose
    project publishes no IPA itself) and every check passed. It is still
    trustworthy, but the build provenance is not the upstream developer.
``UNVERIFIED``
    At least one check failed: invalid metadata, a non-HTTP(S) download URL,
    or the download was unreachable at build time.

Checks performed:

* ``metadata``   — required identity fields are present and well-formed.
* ``urls``       — download/upstream URLs are HTTP(S).
* ``fileAvailable`` — the last link probe considered the primary URL reachable.
* ``hashVerified``  — a SHA-256 digest is known for the newest build (from the
  upstream release's published checksum or the asset digest when the forge
  publishes one).

The result is rendered into ``feeds/verification.json`` and consumed by the
website badges and the duplicated-app recommendations.
