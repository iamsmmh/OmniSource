"""App relationship graph generator.

The catalog intentionally groups apps that share a bundle identifier (e.g.
multiple YouTube / YouTube Music tweaks). That structural signal plus the
declared ``category`` and ``tags`` is enough to surface a useful "if you
installed X you may also like Y" list without any manual curation.

Signals, in priority order:

1. **Bundle identifier** — apps that override the same target bundle are
   semantically the same kind of tool, so the relationship is "alternative".
2. **Same category** — broader affinity.
3. **Same developer** — author affinity.
4. **Shared tags** — niche affinity.

Each related entry is scored 0..1 and the document is consumed by the website
"Related apps" section, the app detail page sidebar and the ``api/related``
endpoint. The graph is symmetric: if A lists B, B lists A.
