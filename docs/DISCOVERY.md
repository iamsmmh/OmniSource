# Autonomous Discovery Engine

OmniSource discovers third-party AltStore / SideStore / Feather / ESign /
LiveContainer sources without human intervention, on a 12-hour schedule
(`.github/workflows/discovery.yml`).

## Passes

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/discovery/discover_github.py` | GitHub code search for `source.json`, `apps.json`, `altsource`, `altstore source`, `sidestore source`, `feather source` (+ `--term` extras) |
| `scripts/discovery/discover_feeds.py` | Probes candidate feed URLs (bare sites expand to likely filenames) and classifies live feeds by client |
| `scripts/discovery/discover_releases.py` | Flags GitHub `owner/repo`s whose releases ship `.ipa`/`.tipa` assets |
| `scripts/discovery/discover_forges.py` | Searches GitLab, Codeberg and configured Forgejo instances for projects with actual IPA/TIPA release assets |
| `scripts/discovery/discover_web_catalogs.py` | Scrapes catalog pages for linked `*.json` feeds and probes each; configured inputs include FMHY's mobile page |
| `scripts/discovery/discover_sources.py` | Orchestrator: applies the sourcing policy, runs every pass, validates, merges into the store |
| `scripts/discovery/find_source_builds.py` | Source-build finder: repos that publish source but no distributable artifact, drafted as recipes for `data/source_builds.json`; never writes the discovery store |

Configured external catalog inputs live in `data/discovery_pages.txt`. FMHY is an index page, not an
AltStore feed, so OmniSource only follows linked JSON feeds that pass validation; it does not blindly
import or redistribute arbitrary downloads from FMHY. Its `iOS Tools` / `iOS iPAs` sections list a lot
of storefronts and re-host libraries alongside real projects — those are not merely "not yet promoted",
they are excluded by the sourcing policy below, which is why feeds such as an aggregator's `cypwn.json`
that discovery found live are dropped instead of merged.

Core logic lives in `src/omnisource/autodiscovery.py` (stdlib-only;
network isolated in `fetch_*` helpers). `--dry-run` prints without writing.

## Store

`data/discovered_sources.json` (`schemas/discovery.schema.json`):

```json
{
  "source_id": "example-com-apps-json-a1b2c3d4e5",
  "name": "octo/source — apps.json",
  "url": "https://example.com/apps.json",
  "type": "altstore",
  "discovered_at": "2026-09-12T00:00:00Z",
  "last_checked": "2026-09-12T12:00:00Z",
  "health": "unknown",
  "reputation": 0
}
```

Merges are keyed by URL: re-discovery refreshes `last_checked` (and
`health` when probed) without duplicating.

## Validation gate (invalid feeds never publish)

`scripts/validation/` (`src/omnisource/remote_validation.py`):

- `validate_source.py` — store schema, https URLs, known types, 0–100
  reputation, and `source_id` shape. Ids are URL-derived (`host-stem-digest`,
  capped at 80 characters by `schemas/discovery.schema.json`) — deliberately
  *not* the 32-character `catalog.json` app-slug rule, which rejected every
  discovered id. `discovery.yml` runs it with `--quarantine-invalid`: an
  invalid record is isolated in `data/quarantine/sources.json` and dropped
  from the store (fail-closed) while the run stays green so the commit step
  persists the quarantine. It still fails when a record cannot be isolated,
  or when an already verified/published record is invalid. Without the flag
  (local runs, `validation.yml`) every finding is a hard error.
- `validate_feed.py` — envelope schema, per-app rules, duplicate bundle
  IDs, optional `--check-downloads` reachability probe.
- `validate_app.py` — single app entry (+ `--check-download`).
- `validate_release.py` — tag, installable assets, digest format.

`assert_publishable()` returns `(ok, errors, warnings)`; anything with
errors is quarantined in `data/quarantine/sources.json` and never merged
toward a feed. Every discovery pass validates its candidates with the same
rules this gate applies, so a record a pass accepted cannot fail the gate.

## Sourcing policy (`data/source_policy.json`)

A reviewed rejection is data, not prose. Each rule names a host (`host` or
`host/path-prefix`), a forge repository, or a name keyword, and carries the reason
plus at least one HTTPS reference. `src/omnisource/source_policy.py` is the single
place that reads it, and it is consulted at every point where a blocked source could
otherwise move forward:

| Gate | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| every discovery writer | `autodiscovery.save_store(…, root=ROOT)` filters *and* prunes, so GitHub search, the GitLab/Codeberg/Forgejo sweep, feed probing, web-catalog scraping and manual revalidation all refuse a blocked source — a new pass cannot bypass the verdict by forgetting to filter |
| `discover_sources.py` | additionally drops candidates before validation, logging the rule id per record |
| `assert_publishable()` | record can never be verified/published, even if hand-edited into the store with a high reputation |
| `scripts/validate.py` | `catalog.json` entry that resolves from, or mirrors, a blocked host is a build error |
| `build-tweak.yml` | the manual patcher refuses to download a base IPA or `.deb` from a blocked host |

The list is one-directional: no rule means "no automated verdict", never "approved".
An unusable policy file fails the run (fail-closed) rather than disabling the check.
`PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m omnisource.source_policy explain` prints the rules;
`check-url` answers "is this allowed, and if not, why".

## Promotion path

Discovery → validation → (`reputation ≥ 25`, healthy) → **explicit
promotion** into `catalog.json` (human PR or a pinned policy — never
automatic). The sync pipeline only reads `catalog.json`, so an
unreviewed discovery cannot reach users by construction.

## Rate limits & degradation

Code search uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` and sleeps between pages; on
any API failure the pass yields zero candidates and exits 0 (a failed
search must never fail the pipeline). Feed/release passes are plain
HTTPS with per-request timeouts and payload caps (2 MB).
